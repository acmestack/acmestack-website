### AcmeStack?

AcmeStack, formerly known as OpeninGO, pays attention to and researches computer open source technology, and aims to use open source to give back to open source.

Due to the misunderstanding that OpeninGO's "inGO" only focuses on Golang-related fields, it was renamed AcmeStack on June 14, 2022.

AcmeStack means top stack, and still inherits the original intention of OpeninGO: to pay attention to and study computer open source technology, aiming to use open source to give back to open source.

### for what？

Open source as we understand it：

- Open Source is a More Innovative Way to Value
- Open source is a way to bring together the wisdom of many people
- Open source is open and inclusive
- Open source is hobby driven

Officially because of these, we have come together to create more valuable things together.

### Who are we？

We are open source enthusiasts from various fields. Some have been in the technical field for more than 20 years, more than 10 years, some have just graduated, and some are not in the technical field, but we got together because of love and interest.
